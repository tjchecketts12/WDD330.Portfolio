      <h2>>CH9: The Window Object</h2>
        - The window object is the global object in a browser.
        - Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser environment.
        - alert , confirm() , and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that halt the execution of the program.
        - The window.navigator object gives information about the user’s browser and operating system, although it can be unreliable.
        - The window.location object provides information about the URL of the current page.
        - The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.
        - You can open, close, resize, and move windows (although, this doesn’t mean you should!).
        - The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.
        - document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.
        - Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property.
        - The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can be canceled using the clearTimeout() method.
        - The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the clearInterval() method.
        - The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.

      <h2>CH 14 HTML5 API's</h2>
        - HTML5.1 is the latest incarnation of the Hypertext Markup Language. It covers a variety of technologies, including several APIs that are accessible using JavaScript.
        - data- attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user experience with JavaScript.
        - The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user’s device in a similar way to cookies, but without the same storage restrictions.
        - The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user’s device, as long as the user gives permission.
        - The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps to avoid websites becoming unresponsive.
        - Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way communication.
        - The Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.
        - The <audio> and <video> elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They also have a Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.
        - The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in real-time using JavaScript.
        - A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.
