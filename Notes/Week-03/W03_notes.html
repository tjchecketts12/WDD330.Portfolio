    <h2>Object Method, "this"</h2>        
    <pre>
    Objects are created to represent entities of the real world. eg. users
    Actions are represented in JavaScript by functions
    It’s common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job.
    "this" is not bound
    
    Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.
    Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().
    Methods can reference the object as this.
    
    The value of this is defined at run-time.
    
    When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is called.
    A function can be copied between objects.
    When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call is object.

    <h2>CH 5 Objects</h2>
    Each property is a key-value pair, separated by commas. 
    To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces. 
    You can access the property using the square bracket notation: [name]
    Each symbol has a unique value, which means that using them as property keys avoids any naming clashes if you mistakenly use the same value for two different property keys.
    It’s even possible for an object to contain other objects. These are known as nested objects. 

    Modifiers
    Modifiers can be placed after a token to deal with multiple occurrences of that token:

    ? makes the preceding token in the regular expression optional
    * matches one or more occurrences of the preceding token
    + matches one or more occurrences of the preceding token
    {n} matchesnoccurrences of the preceding token
    {n,} matches at leastnoccurrences of the pattern
    {,m} matches at mostmoccurrences of the preceding token
    {n,m} matches at leastnand at mostmoccurrences of the preceding token
    ^ marks the position immediately before the first character in the string
    $ marks the position immediately after the last character in the string
    <h2>Chapter 5 Summary</h2>
        Objects are a collection of key-value pairs placed inside curly braces {}.
        Objects have properties that can be any JavaScript value. If it’s a function, it’s known as amethod.
        An object’s properties and methods can be accessed using either dot notation or square bracket notation.
        Objects are mutable, which means their properties and methods can be changed or removed.
        Objects can be used as parameters to functions, which allows arguments to be entered in any order, or omitted.
        Nested objects can be created by placing objects inside objects.
        JSON is a portable data format that uses JavaScript object literals to exchange information.
        The Math object gives access to a number of mathematical constants.
        The Math object can be used to perform mathematical calculations.
        The Date object can be used to create date objects.
        Once you’ve created a Date object, you can use the getter methods to access information about that date.
        Once you’ve created a Date object, setter methods can be used to change information about that date.
        The Regex object can be used to create regular expressions.
    <h2>CH. 6 The Document Object Model</h2>
    The DOM provides several methods that allow us to access any element on a page. These methods will return a node object or a node list, which is an array-like object.
    These objects can then be assigned to a variable and be inspected or modified. 
   
    All nodes have a numerical code to signify what type they are. These are summmarized in the table below.
    Code	Type
    1	element
    2	attribute
    3	text
    8	comment
    9	body

    <h2>Chapter 6 Summary</h2>
        The Document Object Model is a way of representing a page of HTML as a tree of nodes.
        The document.getElementById() , document.getElementsByClassName() , document.getElementsByTagNames() and document.querySelector() can be used to access elements on a page.
        The parentNode() , previousSibling() , nextSibling() , childNodes() and children() methods can be used to navigate around the DOM tree.
        An element’s attributes can be accessed using the getAttribute() method, and updated using the setAttribute() method.
        The createElement() and createTextNode() methods can be used to create dynamic markup on the fly.
        Markup can be added to the page using the appendChild() and insertBefore() methods.
        Elements can be replaced using the replaceChild() method, and removed using the removeChild() method.
        The innerHTML property can be used to insert raw HTML directly into the DOM.
        The CSS properties of an element can be changed by accessing the style property.

    <h2>CH. 7 Events</h2>
    Event Listeners are like setting a notification to alert you when something happens.
    JavaScript, on the other hand, uses anon-blockingapproach that usesevent listenersto listen out for any clicks on the page.
    Code to attach an event listener - document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething); 
    The type property returns the type of event that occurred, such as click.
    Mouse and keyboard events are types of events.

    <h2>Chapter 7 Summary</h2>
        Events occur when a user interacts with a web page.
        An event listener is attached to an element, then invokes a callback function when the event occurs.
        The event object is passed to the callback function as an argument, and contains lots of properties and methods relating to the event.
        There are many types of event, including mouse events, keyboard events, and touch events.
        You can remove an event using the removeEventListener method.
        The default behavior of elements can be prevented using the preventDefault() function.
        Event propagation is the order the events fire on each element.
        Event delegation is when an event listener is added to a parent element to capture events that happen to its children elements.

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    Make the user say Hello!
    </pre>
    <script>
        let user = {
            name: "John",
            age: 30
        };

        /*user.sayHi = function() {
            alert("Hello!");
        };

        user.sayHi(); // Hello!*/
        
        function sayHi(){
            alert("Hello!")
        };

        user.sayHi = sayHi;
        user.sayHi();
    </script>
    <script>    

        const superman = {
    name: 'Superman',
    'real name': 'Clark Kent',
    height: 75,
    weight: 235,
    hero: true,
    villain: false,
    allies: ['Batman','Supergirl','Superboy'],
    fly() {
        return 'Up, up and away!';
    }
};
