      <h2>CH 8 Forms</h2>
        -Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.
        -Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.
        -HTML5 has a large number of new input types that are beginning to be implemented in modern browsers.
        -document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.
        -form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.
        -Forms have focus , blur , and change events that fire as a user interacts with the form.
        -Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form before it’s been submitted.
        -The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value property of the form controls.
        -The HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form, but only at a basic level, so a custom validation script may be required.

      <h2>CH 12 Object Oriented Programming</h2>
        -Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than later.
        -JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string "use strict" . This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.
        -Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions.
        -Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown.
        -The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code.
        -Exceptions can be thrown using the "throw" statement.
        -An error object is created when an exception occurs.
        -Any code placed inside a "try" block will pass any error objects to a "catch" block when an exception occurs. 
        Any code inside a "finally" block will run if an exception does or does not occur.
        -Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the test, 
        then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.
        -The Jest framework can be used to test your code.
