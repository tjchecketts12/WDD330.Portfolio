    <h2>CH 2 Programming Basics</h2>        
    <pre>
        Summary
        - Comments are ignored by the program, but make your program easier to read and understand
        - Data types are the basic building blocks of all JavaScript programs.
        - There are six primitive data types: strings, symbols, numbers, Booleans, undefined and null.
        - Non-primitive data types, such as arrays, functions and objects, all have a type of 'object'.
        - Variables point to values stored in memory and are declared using the const or let keywords.
        - Values are assigned to variables using the = operator.
        - Strings and numbers have various properties and methods that provide information about them.
        - Symbols are unique, immutable values.
        - Boolean values are either true or false .
        - There are only seven values that are false in JavaScript and these are known as 'falsy' values.
        - Data types can be converted into other data types.
        - Type coercion is when JavaScript tries to convert a value into another data type in order to perform an operation.
        - Logical operators can be used to check if compound statements are true or false.
        - Values can be compared to see if they are equal, greater than or less than other values.

    <h2>CH 3 Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
        Summary
        - Arrays are an ordered list of values
        - Multidimensional arrays are arrays that contain other arrays
        - Arrays have lots of methods that can be used to manipulate items in the array
        - Sets are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of non-duplicate values
        - Maps are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of key-value pairs
        - We can use an if and else statement to control the flow of code
        - The switch statement can be used instead of multiple if and else statements
        - A while loop and do ... while loop can be used to repeat a block of code while a condition is still true
        - A for loop works in a similar way to a while loop, but has a different syntax
        - A for-of loop can be used to iterate over an array
        - Sets and maps are enumerable, so can also be looped over using a for-of loop
    
    <h2>CH 4 Functions</h2>
        Summary
        - Functions are first-class objects that behave the same way as other values.
        - Function literals can be defined using the function declaration, or by creating afunction expressionby assigning an anonymous function to a variable.
        - All functions return a value. If this is not explicitly stated, the function will return undefined.
        - A parameter is a value that is written in the parentheses of a function declaration and can be used like a variable inside the functionâ€™s body.
        - An argument is a value that is provided to a function when it is invoked.
        - The arguments variable is an array-like object that allows access to each argument provided to the function using index notation.
        - The rest operator can be used to access multiple arguments as an array.
        - Default arguments can be supplied to a function by assigning them to the parameters.
        - Arrow functions are a new shorthand notation that can used for writing anonymous functions in ES6.
        - Function declarations can be invoked before they are defined because they are hoisted to the top of the scope, but function expressions cannot be invoked until after they are defined.
        - Acallbackis a function that is provided as an argument to another function.
