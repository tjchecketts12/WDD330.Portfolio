      <h2>CH 8 CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h2>
        -Transforms - manipulate an element's appearance. 
            -Translation - allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. Move elements without impacting the flow of the document.
            -Scaling - defined factors horizontally then vertically. The center stays in the same place as its dimensions change.
                       No impact on the document flow. 
            -Rotation - rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. The point of origin is the element's center.
                        positive degrees move clockwise, and negative moves it counter clockwise. 
            -Skew - specifies a skew along the x and y axes. If the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis. 
            -Changing the Origin of the Transform - changes the center of the object.
            - The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction will be on the rotated axis.
        -Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations. 
            -Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations.  
            -The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state.  
            -The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail.
            -The transition properties allow for multiple transitions in one call.
        -Animations 
            -CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.  
            -A keyframe is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition.   
            -The lack of powerful processors on many mobile devices makes CSS animations a great alternative to weighty, CPU-intensive JavaScript animation.
            -The transition properties allow for multiple transitions in one call.

      <h2>CH 12 Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
        -Canvas:  
            -With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns. In addition, canvas gives us the power
             to manipulate pixels in images and even video.
            -The first step to using canvas is to add a canvas element to the page:
            -The canvas element takes both a width and height attribute, which must also be set.
            -Drawing on the Canvas happens via the Canvas JavaScript API.
            -Filling Our Brush with Color - do so with the strokeStyle or fillStyle properties.
            -Drawing a Rectangle to the Canvas - do this by calling the fillRect and strokeRect methods.  Both of these methods take the X and Y 
             coordinates where you want to begin drawing the fill or the stroke, and the width and height of the rectangle. 
            -Paths create a blueprint for your lines, arcs, and shapes, but paths are invisible until you give them a stroke! With more complex shapes, 
             we need to take three steps: layout the path, stroke the path, and fill the path. 
            -The signature for the arc method is: arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise). 
        -Manipulating Images 
            -We can use the getImageData method from the Canvas API to manipulate the pixels of that image.
            -getImageData takes four parameters, corresponding to the four corners of a rectangular piece of the canvas we’d like to inspect.
            -Converting an Image from Color to Black and White
            -A keyframe is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition.   
            -The lack of powerful processors on many mobile devices makes CSS animations a great alternative to weighty, CPU-intensive JavaScript animation.
            -The transition properties allow for multiple transitions in one call.
