      <h2>MDN: Validating Forms</h2>
        - Client-side form validation sometimes requires JavaScript if you want to customize styling and error messages, 
          but it always requires you to think carefully about the user. Always remember to help your users correct the data they provide. 
          To that end, be sure to:
            - Display explicit error messages.
            - Be permissive about the input format.
            - Point out exactly where the error occurs, especially on large forms.
        
        - Once you have checked that the form is filled out correctly, the form can be submitted.

      <h2>MDN: Using Fetch</h2>
        - The fetch specification differs from jQuery.ajax() in three main ways:
            - The Promise returned from fetch() won’t reject on HTTP error status even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. 
              Instead, it will resolve normally (with ok status set to false), and it will only reject on network failure or 
              if anything prevented the request from completing.
            - fetch() can receive cross-site cookies; you can establish a cross site session using fetch. 
            - fetch won’t send cookies, unless you set the credentials init option. (Since Aug 25, 2017. The spec changed the 
              default credentials policy to same-origin. Firefox changed since 61.0b13.)
        - Checking that the fetch was successful
            - A fetch() promise will reject with a TypeError when a network error is encountered or CORS is misconfigured on 
              the server-side, although this usually means permission issues or similar — a 404 does not constitute a network 
              error, for example. An accurate check for a successful fetch() would include checking that the promise resolved, 
              then checking that the Response.ok property has a value of true. 
        - Headers
            - The Headers interface allows you to create your own headers object via the Headers() constructor.
        - Response Objects
            - Response instances are returned when fetch() promises are resolved. The most common response properties you'll use are:
                - Response.status — An integer (default value 200) containing the response status code.
                - Response.statusText — A string (default value "OK"), which corresponds to the HTTP status code message.
                - Response.ok — seen in use above, this is a shorthand for checking that status is in the range 200-299 inclusive. This returns a Boolean.
        - Body 
            - Both requests and responses may contain body data. A body is an instance of any of the following types:
                - ArrayBuffer
                - ArrayBufferView (Uint8Array and friends)
                - Blob/File
                - string
                - URLSearchParams
                - FormData
            - The Body mixin defines the following methods to extract a body (implemented by both Request and Response). These all return a promise that 
              is eventually resolved with the actual content.
                - arrayBuffer()
                - blob()
                - json()
                - text()
                - formData()
            - This makes usage of non-textual data much easier than it was with XHR.
